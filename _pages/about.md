Hi there! I am a PhD student of genomics at Edinburgh University. As such, I research cancer multiomics to understand oncogenesis and cancer progression and ultimately improve cancer outcome. 

My previous [research projects](/projects/) spanned everything from (epi-)genomics, over single-cell analysis to machine-learning. 
In the process, I investigated DNA fragility, predicted gene pathway defects from genetic scars, and found changes in epigenetic states from single-cell MNase-seq data.
Throughout this time I gathered experience in best practices in data science, developed skills in machine-learning, and learned a lot about assessing omics through sequencing.

Want to learn more? Feel free to get in touch, I am always happy to chat over an informal coffee. You can find my contact details by clicking on one of the three buttons on the top left.
